                <p>The city’s skyline is decorated by lots of sky scrapers and other high rise buildings.
                    Parallel to industries, the city has also seen an increase in the number of educational institutions delivering quality education, shopping malls and other recreation facilities for people. All these reasons have contributed to Gurgaon being the preferred destination for people to settle in permanently.

Plots in Gurgaon are selling like hot pancakes, since the property value is steadily increasing by the day and it turns out to be a good investment for people wanting to buy properties in the city, since the city of Delhi is also close by and people do not mind shuttling between Delhi and Gurgaon for work.

A number of developers and builders find the city a great place for their development activities since the takers for the plots and properties are on the high. The development activities in the city are on a very rapid pace so as to race way ahead of Delhi in terms of civic administration, infrastructure, growth of industries etc.

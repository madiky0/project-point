                <p>A traveler tells about his trip and reviews his stay at Paradise Island Harbour resort.

                    Although the hotel requires some renovation it still provides a satisfactory experience and worth the money. When I read the other reviews on Paradise Island Harbour Resort I was sceptical about staying here. When we drove up to the hotel, I was even more sceptical - it clearly is not the fancy hotel on the outside like the others on the island.
                    
                    We checked in with no problem. Our room was ready when we arrived. We upgraded to the balcony view. The room was very clean. The drinks were wonderful. The food in the dining room was hit or miss. The first night we were not impressed but the second night the food was terrific. I would definitely stay at this hotel again. Easy access to the pool and food. Short walk to the casino without the crowd.
